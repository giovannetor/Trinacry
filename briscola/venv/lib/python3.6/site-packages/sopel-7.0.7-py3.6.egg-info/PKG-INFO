        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Sopel is a simple, lightweight, open source, easy-to-use IRC Utility bot,
        written in Python. It's designed to be easy to use, run and extend.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Latest stable release
        =====================
        On most systems where you can run Python, the best way to install Sopel is to
        install `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_ and then ``pip install sopel``.
        
        Arch users can install the ``sopel`` package from the [community] repository,
        though new versions might take slightly longer to become available.
        
        Failing both of those options, you can grab the latest tarball `from GitHub
        <https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel/releases/latest>`_  and follow the steps
        for installing from the latest source below.
        
        Latest source
        =============
        First, either clone the repository with ``git clone
        git://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel.git`` or download a tarball `from GitHub
        <https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel/releases/latest>`_.
        
        Note: Sopel requires Python 2.7.x or Python 3.3+ to run. On Python 2.7,
        Sopel requires ``backports.ssl_match_hostname`` to be installed. Use
        ``pip install backports.ssl_match_hostname`` or
        ``yum install python-backports.ssl_match_hostname`` to install it, or download
        and install it manually `from PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/backports.ssl_match_hostname>`_.
        
        Note: Python 2.x is near end of life. Sopel will drop support in version 8.0.
        
        In the source directory (whether cloned or from the tarball) run ``pip install
        -e .``. You can then run ``sopel`` to configure and start the bot.
        
        Database support
        ----------------
        Sopel leverages SQLAlchemy to support the following database types: SQLite,
        MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Oracle, Firebird, and Sybase. By default Sopel will
        use a SQLite database in the current configuration directory, but alternative
        databases can be configured with the following config options: ``db_type``,
        ``db_filename`` (SQLite only), ``db_driver``, ``db_user``, ``db_pass``,
        ``db_host``, ``db_port``, and ``db_name``. You will need to manually install
        any packages (system or ``pip``) needed to make your chosen database work.
        
        **Note:** Plugins not updated since Sopel 7.0 was released *might* have
        problems with database types other than SQLite (but many will work just fine).
        
        Adding plugins
        --------------
        The easiest place to put new plugins is in ``~/.sopel/plugins``. Some newer
        plugins are installable as packages; `search PyPI
        <https://pypi.org/search/?q=%22sopel%22>`_ for these. Many more plugins
        written by other users can be found using your favorite search engine.
        
        Some older, unmaintained plugins are available in the
        `sopel-extras <https://github.com/sopel-irc/sopel-extras>`_ repository, but of
        course you can also write your own. A `tutorial <https://sopel.chat/tutorials/part-1-writing-plugins/>`_
        for creating new plugins is available on Sopel's website.
        API documentation can be found online at https://sopel.chat/docs/, or
        you can create a local version by running ``make docs``.
        
        Further documentation
        ---------------------
        
        The `official website <https://sopel.chat/>`_ includes such valuable information
        as a full listing of built-in `commands <https://sopel.chat/usage/commands/>`_,
        `tutorials <https://sopel.chat/tutorials/>`_, `API documentation <https://sopel.chat/docs/>`_,
        and other `usage information <https://sopel.chat/usage/>`_.

        Financial support
        -----------------
        
        We're thrilled that you want to support the project!
        
        We have applied for access to organization-level sponsorship from GitHub. In
        the interim, if you wish to contribute sooner, you are welcome to do so
        through `Open Collective <https://opencollective.com/sopel>`_ or sponsor
        Sopel's maintainer, `dgw <https://github.com/sponsors/dgw>`_, individually.
        
        Any donations received will be used to cover infrastructure costs, such as our
        domain name and hosting services. Our main project site is easily hosted by
        `Netlify <https://www.netlify.com/>`_, but we are considering building a few
        new features that would require more than static hosting. All project-related
        `expenses <https://opencollective.com/sopel/expenses>`_ are tracked on our
        Open Collective profile, for transparency.
