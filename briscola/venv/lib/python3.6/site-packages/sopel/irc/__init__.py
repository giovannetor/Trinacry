""":mod:`sopel.irc` is the core IRC module for Sopel.

This sub-package contains everything that is related to the IRC protocol
(connection, commands, abstract client, etc.) and that can be used to implement
the Sopel bot.

In particular, it defines the interface for the
:class:`IRC backend<sopel.irc.abstract_backends.AbstractIRCBackend>`, and the
interface for the :class:`bot itself<sopel.irc.AbstractBot>`. This is all
internal code that isn't supposed to be used directly by a plugin developer,
who should worry about :class:`sopel.bot.Sopel` only.

.. important::

    When working on core IRC protocol related features, consult protocol
    documentation at https://www.irchelp.org/protocol/rfc/

        By prefixing the capability with ``-``, it will be ensured that the
        capability is not enabled. Similarly, by prefixing the capability with
        ``=``, it will be ensured that the capability is enabled. Requiring and
        disabling is "first come, first served"; if one module requires a
        capability, and another prohibits it, this function will raise an
        exception in whichever module loads second. An exception will also be
        raised if the module is being loaded after the bot has already started,
        and the request would change the set of enabled capabilities.

        If the capability is not prefixed, and no other module prohibits it, it
        will be requested. Otherwise, it will not be requested. Since
        capability requests that are not mandatory may be rejected by the
        server, as well as by other modules, a module which makes such a
        request should account for that possibility.

        The actual capability request to the server is handled after the
        completion of this function. In the event that the server denies a
        request, the ``failure_callback`` function will be called, if provided.
        The arguments will be a :class:`~sopel.bot.Sopel` object, and the
        capability which was rejected. This can be used to disable callables
        which rely on the capability. It will be be called either if the server
        NAKs the request, or if the server enabled it and later DELs it.

        The ``success_callback`` function will be called upon acknowledgment
        of the capability from the server, whether during the initial
        capability negotiation, or later.

        If ``arg`` is given, and does not exactly match what the server
        provides or what other modules have requested for that capability, it is
