    :param bool join_threads: whether message functions should join running
                              threads before returning (default: ``True``)

    This mock object helps developers when they want to simulate an IRC server
    sending messages to the bot.

    The default ``join_threads`` behavior is suitable for testing most common
    plugin callables, and ensures that all callables dispatched by the ``bot``
    in response to messages sent via this ``MockIRCServer`` are finished
    running before execution can continue. If set to ``False``, the mock
    server will not wait for the bot to finish processing threaded
    :term:`callables <Plugin callable>` before returning.

    .. note::

        You can override ``join_threads`` on a per-method-call basis with the
        ``blocking`` arguments to the instance methods below.

    The :class:`~sopel.tests.factories.IRCFactory` factory can be used to
    create such mock object, either directly or by using ``py.test`` and the
    :func:`~sopel.tests.pytest_plugin.ircfactory` fixture.

          present in ``channel``
        * a ``RPL_ENDOFNAMES`` event (366) for completion

        Use this to emulate when the bot joins a channel, and the server
        replies with the list of connected users::

            factory.channel_joined('#test', ['Owner', '@ChanServ'])

        In this example, the bot will know that there are 2 other users present
        in ``#test``: "Owner" (a regular user) and "ChanServ" (which is a
        channel operator). Note that the bot itself will be added to the list
        of users automatically, and you **should not** pass it in the ``users``
        parameter.

        a channel.
