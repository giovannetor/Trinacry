"""Sopel's plugin jobs management.

.. versionadded:: 7.1

.. important::

    This is all fresh and new. Its usage and documentation is for Sopel core
    development and advanced developers. It is subject to rapid changes
    between versions without much (or any) warning.

    Do **not** build your plugin based on what is here, you do **not** need to.

        This class is a specific implementation of the scheduler, made to store
