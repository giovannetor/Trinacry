""":mod:`sopel.irc` is the core IRC module for Sopel.

This sub-package contains everything that is related to the IRC protocol
(connection, commands, abstract client, etc.) and that can be used to implement
the Sopel bot.

In particular, it defines the interface for the
:class:`IRC backend<sopel.irc.abstract_backends.AbstractIRCBackend>`, and the
interface for the :class:`bot itself<sopel.irc.AbstractBot>`. This is all
internal code that isn't supposed to be used directly by a plugin developer,
who should worry about :class:`sopel.bot.Sopel` only.

.. important::

    When working on core IRC protocol related features, consult protocol
    documentation at https://www.irchelp.org/protocol/rfc/

        By prefixing the capability with ``-``, it will be ensured that the
        capability is not enabled. Similarly, by prefixing the capability with
        ``=``, it will be ensured that the capability is enabled. Requiring and
        disabling is "first come, first served"; if one plugin requires a
        capability, and another prohibits it, this function will raise an
        exception in whichever plugin loads second. An exception will also be
        raised if the plugin is being loaded after the bot has already started,
        and the request would change the set of enabled capabilities.

        If the capability is not prefixed, and no other plugin prohibits it, it
        will be requested. Otherwise, it will not be requested. Since
        capability requests that are not mandatory may be rejected by the
        server, as well as by other plugins, a plugin which makes such a
        request should account for that possibility.

        The actual capability request to the server is handled after the
        completion of this function. In the event that the server denies a
        request, the ``failure_callback`` function will be called, if provided.
        The arguments will be a :class:`~sopel.bot.Sopel` object, and the
        capability which was rejected. This can be used to disable callables
        which rely on the capability. It will be be called either if the server
        NAKs the request, or if the server enabled it and later DELs it.

        The ``success_callback`` function will be called upon acknowledgment
        of the capability from the server, whether during the initial
        capability negotiation, or later.

        If ``arg`` is given, and does not exactly match what the server
        provides or what other plugins have requested for that capability, it is

        :param str text: the text to send
        :param str recipient: the message recipient
        :param int max_messages: split ``text`` into at most this many messages
                                 if it is too long to fit in one (optional)
        :param str truncation: string to append if ``text`` is too long to fit
                               in a single message, or into the last message if
                               ``max_messages`` is greater than 1 (optional)
        :param str trailing: string to append after ``text`` and (if used)
                             ``truncation`` (optional)

        By default, this will attempt to send the entire ``text`` in one
        message. If the text is too long for the server, it may be truncated.

        If ``max_messages`` is given, the ``text`` will be split into at most
        that many messages. The split is made at the last space character
        before the "safe length" (which is calculated based on the bot's
        nickname and hostmask), or exactly at the "safe length" if no such
        space character exists.

        If the ``text`` is too long to fit into the specified number of messages
        using the above splitting, the final message will contain the entire
        remainder, which may be truncated by the server. You can specify
        ``truncation`` to tell Sopel how it should indicate that the remaining
        ``text`` was cut off. Note that the ``truncation`` parameter must
        include leading whitespace if you desire any between it and the
        truncated text.

        The ``trailing`` parameter is *always* appended to ``text``, after the
        point where ``truncation`` would be inserted if necessary. It's useful
        for making sure e.g. a link is always included, even if the summary your
        plugin fetches is too long to fit.

        Here are some examples of how the ``truncation`` and ``trailing``
        parameters work, using an artificially low maximum line length::

            # bot.say() outputs <text> + <truncation?> + <trailing>
            #                   always     if needed       always

                '"This is a short quote.',
                truncation=' [â¦]',
                trailing='"')
            # Sopel says: "This is a short quote."

            bot.say(
                '"This quote is very long and will not fit on a line.',
                truncation=' [â¦]',
                trailing='"')
            # Sopel says: "This quote is very long [â¦]"

            bot.say(
                # note the " included at the end this time
                '"This quote is very long and will not fit on a line."',
