# easter_egg

Hi, this little code wants to provide a MAX of 3 eggs to users requiring them for the Easter Hunt Event of the Youth Team.

## Commands avaible:

1. .easteregg  : only command used by users. Notices the image of the egg.      
1. .giveegg    : only used by admins. Manually give an egg to an user, avoiding the counter.  

# What the BOT does

    Executes the command .easteregg.
    When the command is executed, an image of an Easter egg is noticed to the user.

## Details

    The egg can be requested by a single user, only 3 times (to avoid spamming in the channel through the command itself);
    To allow this, the user's nick will be temporarily stored in a dictionary instantiated when the BOT is started.
    This dictionary is not accessible and is deleted every time the BOT is restarted (therefore, there is no real data collection);
    BOT administrators will be able to use the command .giveegg to manually give an egg to a user, avoiding the counter.
