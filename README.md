This repos is a folder of all my work about Trinacry, all in one place! ＼(^o^)／

## What's inside?
1. `Sbaddu` : miscellaneous folder, contains the following:
    - *supertest* : basically a play ground.
    - *food* : every true Italian has a module for foods.
    - *ping_echo* : reports all the owner pings in log chan  
    - *announce* : Contains a custom announce module (Sopel's one was broken, too lazy to fix it...)
    
1. `Trichan` : Trinacry's channel management module. Adds some cool stuff to Sopel standard.

1. `Poker` : The game POKER to play on IRC!
