##What it does
1. *rule* `BANG` : Kicks a random user
2. *rule* `POWAH` : Gives OP power to the user. Requires bot_admin
3. *rule* `mask` : Removes OP from a user. Requires bot_admin
4. *cmd* `destroy` : Kick and Bans a user. Nick based. Requires bot_owner
5. *cmd* `resurrect` : Unban and Invited a user. Nick based. Requires bot_owner
6. *rule* `echo` : Repeats every private message the bot receives, in the log chan.
7. *ev* `autop` : Flag substitute, allows auto modes based on NickServ accounts. (Used mostly for halfvoice)
8. *cmd* `do` : Used to execute dommands. *WIP*
9. *ncom* `hv|hvoice|halfvoice` : Required for a +V if deserved (be gentle)
