# TicTacToe

Hi. This is a lil module to play TicTacToe on IRC with Trinacry. 

##What it does
1. *cmd* `ttt` : Starts the game.
2. *cmd* `grid` : Shows the actual grid.
3. *cmd* `play` : Put your sign on a slot. *ex: `.play A2`*
4. *cmd* `join` : Joins the match.
5. *cmd* `adstop` (admin only) : Forcefully stops the game.
